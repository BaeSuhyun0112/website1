  Many industry reports have confirmed that a significant majority of consumers want safe and secure access to the Web from their connected car. Yet vehicle-specific application platforms have limited appeal to developers because the market size is small (compared to mobile devices, for example) and there is a high cost to learning and developing code for multiple platforms. On the other hand, the Open Web Platform is a scalable solution for apps in connected cars enabling companies to capitalize on this connectivity trend:<br>
  It is the most interoperable system available
It is a decentralized, neutral platform, and W3C standards are designed to be Royalty-Free.
Open standards designed to run anywhere lower the cost of creating apps (including hybrid)
No app installation is required, updates happen over the air, and apps work offline as well.
A large developer community has years of experience with Web technologies.
With active participation from the automotive industry, W3C is working to bring drivers and passengers a rich Web experience.
<br>
Ensuring the Web Meets Industry Requirements
That is why, in 2013 the automotive industry launched the Automotive and Web Platform Business Group to ensure that the Open Web Platform will meet the unique needs of the automotive industry, and to help stakeholders within the automotive industry to build a good and practical understanding on the standardization processes within the W3C. As of early 2015, more than 50 companies and organizations participate in the group.
<br>
The group published completed drafts at the end of 2014 and is now looking at how to integrate the media tuner and speech interfaces into Web applications.
